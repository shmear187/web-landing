## A new beginning

[Dishonored Motorcycle Club Lore]

**Dishonered MC**, the story of disgraced soldiers only seeking freedom and triumph, though they are freshly established, their history stems long and wide. Originating as the terrorist group from the Bosnian sector of former Yugoslavia, The Black Hand over 100 years ago, they were notoriously known as the organization that kicked off the start of World War 1. People thought they had been condemned and disbanded from that point, however The Black Hand had always remained in the shadows. 

Through over a century they involved themselves in many key points in history, through different aliases and disguises, they were experts in espionage, assassinations, warfare and cyber warfare. They caused many governments to crumble and many countries to burn, but always remained in the shadows. 

After many years of seclusion and operations that no one knew the truth about, after taking control of the helm of the organization, Vin and Sam wanted recognition for their cause and their army. They took aim of the crime riddled city of Los Santos where they aimed to take control of the corrupt government and run over the rampant gang scene. Through this process, they went through many trials and tribulations. With the dictating head of the federal police Sanderson trying to stop them at any cause and every gang aiming their sights at them, they constantly found themselves directly in war with anyone and everyone that decided to step to them or step foot in Paleto, which they now recognized as their home. 

Through the journey, they lost and found many soldiers, their most loyal men Mason, Swish, Pine and Lemon stayed loyal above all else and helped them achieve true greatness. Eventually Vin retired and Sam took over, in which more men stepped up and showed leadership within the organization, being Cruzy and Jimmy. The gang continued to enjoy great success and really proclaimed themselves as the top of the food chain for a good period of time, wiping out anyone that tried to lay claim to their throne, however all great things must come to an end eventually...

Sam decided to retire and now with both Vin and him gone, the great Bosnian lineage within The Black Hand had faded. With respect to those that came before them, Mason and Swish carried out their legacy, and kept The Black Hand going. However, as time passed, the tyranny and ideals of The Black Hand had faded, Mason and Swish were both 1%ers to the bone. They preferred a notorious life of freedom, a life with no rules, no code. Along with what was left of The Black Hand and those that shared their dreams, they laid down their vests and embarked on a new journey. Though they never let go of their connections and trades within the Los Santos black market and underground, they now did things how they wanted, as the Dishonered MC they no longer wanted to take over the world, rather enjoy the freedom of it.

*Live by the sword, die by the sword.*
